Plot.ly Homework 
(Belly Button Biodiversity)


This assignment builds an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.ie (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

    


The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
